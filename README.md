  * :running: `D-Pad`, `Left Stick`, `Arrow Keys` or `WASD` keys to move.
  * :facepunch: Press `X (xbox)`, `H`, `O` or `Enter` to punch.
  * :rage3: Press `A (xbox)`, `J`, `P` or `Backspace` to kick.

Here are some hints.


  * Move, move, move. Don't let the enemies surround you. Try to stack them together and then hit them.
  * Kicks knock enemies back farther than punches, but they do less damage.
  * Get food to heal yourself. The bigger the dish, the more hitpoints you'll get restored. Also, make sure you look behind the objects in each level.
